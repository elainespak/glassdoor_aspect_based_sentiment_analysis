They have a work process which is nearly impossible to follow because the productivity system does not give you time to follow it.\n\nThey claim to be innovative, but they do not listen to their workers at all, and nepotism and favoritism are very common.   Advancement is possible if you know how to kiss up to management.  Nobody gets promoted because they actually work, which leads to poor leadership and management.  \n\nThere is no recognition at all.  They use a program that you can write good things about what others do, and give you a piece of paper for lasting another year of their abusive scheduling practices.  If you get on second or third shift, it takes forever to get on first (which is the goal of many of us) because the job postings only go by seniority, not attendance or productivity.  \n\nTheir point systems for attendance are far too strict.  The abusive scheduling practices wear people down, even though we now have a weekend crew that they claimed would take away forced overtime.  Instead, they just overcrowd the warehouse, which severely limits productivity.

They do not understand consumer driven businesses and do not adopt their business models and practices accordingly.  If you come from a consumer based company, you will be very disappointed.  Marketing budgets are consistently the first area to be cut and the company spends at approximately 1/3 of what other traditional CPG companies spend on marketing.   They very  much adopt the mindset of 'if you build a better mousetrap'.  \r\n\r\nThe company freely moves people in to roles where they have no experience or expertise.  While I can appreciate the willingness to allow people to move freely within the company, they assign people to roles based on tenure, not experience or expertise.   People with supply chain backgrounds run marketing, customer service backgrounds run sales departments and operations experts work in finance.  Without a doubt, the core of this company is built around technical (R&amp;D) and operations.  They do not understand nor care about marketing, strategy or sales.   While the company claims to be focused on 'growth', all internal indications and behaviors clearly demonstrate they are focused on their historical nature of being a 'dividend' company. \r\n\r\nThe company as a whole is terrible at prioritizing: every project, tactic and strategy is a priority.  If you ask what is priority, the most common response will be 'all of them'.  This lack of decisions making is consistent up and down leadership levels throughout the company.  Very little, if any, decision making and prioritization is driven down in to the organization and employees are not empowered nor entrusted to make key decisions. \r\n\r\nBecause of the historical pension program, the motivation is low among more tenured employees.  Many are due to retire in the near future, with those that are near retirement uninterested in new ideas, business strategies or breakthrough innovation.  The overall goal is to get to retirement without any significant change.  Those with longer tenures do not value outside experience.  Their is an unspoken understanding that those with outside experience are known for having 'A3' and 'B3' experience (i.e A.D. and B.C.). \r\nOnly experience gained with 3M tends to be valued by other 3M'ers who have been with the company for most of their careers.  The overall culture focuses on  'checking the box' and 'falling in line with your boss'.   While titles appear to show a flat organization, make no mistake, decision making is very much hierarchical.

Because the company is so large and diversified, there are a lot of opportunities to work in different industries and in different roles. Average tenure at 3M is incredibly long (it's not uncommon for employees to have 30+ years at 3M) which I think speaks to the ability to have a career with a lot of variety all at one company. Additionally, there is a strong culture of learning and development. There are constantly seminars and forums for employees to engage in continuous learning and there is generally an enthusiasm around collaboration and continuous improvement.", "cons": "3M is largely behind other local Fortune 500 companies in terms of benefits for working parents. If you are thinking about  accepting a position at 3M and have a family or are considering starting a family in the next 5 years, I would strongly encourage you to discern whether or not you have the financial means to take an unpaid FMLA and/or use all of your vacation time for parenting leave. For maternity leave, you are eligible for 6 - 8 weeks (depending on the type of delivery) of short term disability and any additional time must be taken unpaid. The short term disability benefit varies by years of service, but for most people I know around the office who are expecting they will receive one week of full pay (provided they don't use any sick days in the last 12 months) and 60% pay for the 6-8 weeks. Any leave a new mother wants to take beyond that is unpaid. In the worst case, if a woman must go on bedrest before leave, her family stands to take a huge financial hit. For paternity leave, the official policy of 3m is that one day can be used for the day of the birth. If a father would like to take parenting leave, he can either use vacation or take FMLA unpaid. These policies are in stark contrast to what other local Fortune 500 companies offer (Target recently announced two weeks paid paternity leave and has updated their maternity leave benefits for 2016, Thomson Reuters has 12 weeks paid for maternity and 2 weeks for paternity, UnitedHealth Group also offers 12 weeks paid for maternity leave,  Best Buy offers 5 weeks paid for maternity). Additionally, only two weeks of paid vacation is offered to new employees in contrast to other competitors that offer three weeks (Boston Scientific, Target, TR, UnitedHealth Group). Lastly, despite a corporate initiative called \"Flex-Ability\", working from home is still a faux pax and you need to convince supervisors that it can be more productive and often essential to balance the needs of work and home. There is still a strong culture of \"butts in seats\". In an age where companies are acknowledging that employees are retained and more productive when they are able to balance their priorities at work and home, it seems short sighted that 3M likes to boast a competitive compensation package as well as a great company for women when its policies so clearly state the opposite.", "advice": "It's no secret that the employee base at 3M is aging and many people are retiring. If the company wants to attract new talent, they need to make dramatic changes to parenting leave, vacation, and work accommodations. We live in a day and age where we're increasingly connected and work doesn't need to happen within the hours of 9 - 5 and in a 6x6 cube. Additionally, younger employees increasingly look for jobs that allow emoployees to be good stewards of their company and good parents.

So if no one signs the board whoever has the lowest # of worked hours has to do it regardless of whatever plans you may have for when you get off work.  You don't find out if you have to work until your 1/2 way through the shift.  It's hard to plan things when your not sure if you will have to work or not.  Also they have a point system in regards to punishment.  The system escalates from 1-5.  No big deal.  However one of the most insane things I've ever encountered is being punished for being sick.  If you call in sick you get a point for missing the day.  But if you stay out 3 days and come in with a DR's note there's no punishment.

The work load was not too extensive for me, but that may have been due to the in-fighting across teams that allowed very little to get assigned and done.  They had a decent web mail client, which, given managers' propensity to answer and send all emails after 8pm was a life saver.", "cons": "I would not know where to start here. Most employees have been there for 10-20+ years, so this particular division did not take kindly to outsiders. The in-fighting between teams was so extensive that I was given a list of people to \"not respond to via email or phone.\" I was also told not to attend meetings without approval from my manager to ensure my expertise was not \"stolen\" by \"the enemy.\" Yuck. I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in, due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it, and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also, I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors, agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company.  I was not aware of anyone who seemed \"happy\" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled, ever. \r\n\r\nI finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. \r\n\r\nFrom a sheer \"company\" perspective, the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch, beverages, etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day, and offered the worst, most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen, anywhere. To avoid waste, they provided less food than needed, and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there, so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read, ramp-up on, or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated, manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid, too, unless you live out that way. \r\n\r\nThere was no discernible process to anything, and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver, to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on, what would come up as \"due\" at any time, or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was \"kicked off of\") than in meetings about viable projects. \r\n\r\nI attempted to address all of these issues over and over, to no result, and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never \"blamed\" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. \r\n\r\nIt might be fine for folks that have been there forever, and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy. I didn't stay long enough to find out. I actually saw one person start and quit within a week while I was there. If you offer valuable expertise and have worked for other companies be ready for a massive culture shock.", "advice": "Play nicely, and serve the customer, not your egos, infighting or chest-beating. Leverage expertise that you did not previously have internally when it is offered to you. Stop talking badly about other managers to their team members, and do not slight their team members or discount their expertise due to your own upper-level politics.  Plan, and then follow through. Work smart, not hard, and use the proper vendors/agencies for what you are trying to accomplish, rather than agencies you are \"friends with\" who may not have the skills needed to do the job. If you are going to swear and talk badly of others, close your office door. Sitting outside your office and hearing it all day is not fun and quickly lowers morale.

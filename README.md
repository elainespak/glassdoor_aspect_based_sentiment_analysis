# ABSA with Glassdoor company reviews
Glassdoor allows job hunters to *shop* for a company based on anonymous reviews, just like customers shopping for items from online shopping malls.

I collected Glassdoor review data of every company who belonged to S&P 500 at least once from year 2008 to 2018.
